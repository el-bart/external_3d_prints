# Saturn V rocket

from [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45316/files).

the model has been slightly reworked by me, namely:
- added scaling factor (`datail/config.scad`) for the whole model.
- adding supports to stage 1's top part, so that it does not collapse on higher scales.
- designed protective ball for the top of stage 4 (safer for small children).

## printing times
- stage 1: 14h 45m
- stage 2: 8h 20m
- stage 3: 11h 50m
- stage 4: 10h 00m
