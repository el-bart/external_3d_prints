## orignal description

### Summary

This is a 1/5th scale replica of the JPL Mars Helicopter "Ingenuity".

### Print Settings
* Printer: Phrozen Shuffle
* Rafts: No
* Supports: Yes
* Resolution: .05mm
* Notes:
  *  The majority of the parts need to be printed on a resin SLA or DLP printer.
  * `Chassis_bottom` and `Solar_panel` can be printed on an FFD printer.
    The solar panel looks good printed in black PLA onto a glass bed, as the surface will look like solar cells.

### Parts checklist

You will need to print the following parts to assemble a complete helicopter model:
* `blade_lower_01` x 1
* `blade_lower_02` x 1
* `blade_upper_01` x 1
* `blade_upper_02` x 1
* `chassis_bottom` x 1
* `chassis_top` x 1
* `solar_panel` x 1
* `rotor_spacer` x 2
* `rotor_swash_plate` x 2
* `foot` x 4

You will also need:
* Aluminium foil
* Masking tape
* 2mm diameter, 50mm length carbon fiber rod x 4
* 3mm diameter, 74mm length carbon fiber tube x 1
* Superglue (cyanoacryate glue)


### Assembly

Paint the resin parts black. Paint the exposed parts of the `chassis_top` silver.
Paint the solar panel with gold paint to match the photo below.

Glue `chassis_top` and `chassis_bottom` together and wrap them in aluminium foil to match the appearance of the real helicopter.
Hold the foil in place with small strips of masking tape.

Glue each foot onto the end of the 2mm carbon fiber rods and insert them into chassis top.

Insert the 3mm carbon fiber rod into the chassis and then thread on the remaining parts in this order:
* `rotor_swash_plate`
* `blade_lower_01`
* `blade_lower_02`
* `rotor_spacer`
* `rotor_swash_plate`
* `blade_upper_01`
* `blade_upper_02`
* `rotor_spacer`
* `solar_panel`
