1. Print the pieces with 20% infill, without support or rafts.
2. Heat the NanoHack to 55ยบ-60ยบ C with a hairdryer or hot water. The circular part has to be intact, that's why it's thicker so that it doesn't deform.
3. When softening, bring together the nose wings and adjustment wings located on the lower jaw. You can glue them to fix them better if you want.
4. Heat it up again and put it on your face for final adjustments. Make sure it's not too hot! If you feel that there is some part of the mask that does not fit well or is too tight, you can put a small piece of soft rubber in the contact areas.
5. Screw the "cover" on with one or two additional filters. If you use a filter, you can use a circular piece (single or double) of a conventional mask (nonwoven propylene) or add a round facial cotton pad for makeup. Half pad can make breathing easier.
6. Add the elastics/straps.
